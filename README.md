Scheduler Simulator
===================

Scheduler Simulator is a 2013/14 Real-Time Systems course project.

The project's goal is to simulate the behavior of a [Preemptive or Non-Preemptive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing\)) [Priority-Driven Scheduler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing\)#Fixed_priority_pre-emptive_scheduling) on a Dynamic Task System on [Multiprocessors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessor).

The project is completely written in C++ and platform independent.
